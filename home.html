    <div class="about-watches2"><p>We are importing our watches from Switzerland.Swiss watches have long been considered some of the best in the industry. Switzerland is home to many of the oldest brands in the watchmaking world and still produces many of the most innovative and cutting-edge watches in the world.
        Because of this, Switzerland is a frequent destination for many watch collectors </p></div>

        <div class="p-home"><p>Excited as we are about these new developments, we are well aware that a luxury watch is a serious investment  and one that needs equally serious consideration as well as a fair bit of knowledge. That's why we have created The Luxury Watch Guide, a new area of the site dedicated entirely to the things that  forgive us  make us tick. Here, you will find extensive information on all the brands we carry as well as advice on how to choose and care for your watch, alongside our latest watch-focused editorial stories from The Journal and The Daily.</p></div>
